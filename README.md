# Loan Default Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts loan default risk using real-world banking data.
The model focuses on improving recall for default cases to reduce credit risk.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle Loan Default Dataset
- Target: not.fully.paid (1 = Default, 0 = Paid)

## Model
- Logistic Regression
- Feature Scaling
- Class-weighted approach for imbalanced data

## Result
